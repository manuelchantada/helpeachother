An app to create social awareness, offer and ask for aid of any kind. 

Nowadays we live in a world where we are more and more connected in incredible and very dinamic ways.

This app aims to serve as a way to give and ask for help of any kind. From food to psicological aid.

Have you found yourself wanting to do something for others in your scarce free time? I did.
But most of those impulses where clouded by the vast amount of instantanous things one can do. It just won't last to get real.

So we need to make it easy, fast, dinamic, interesting and possibly fun.

I found the programming community to be strongly supportive, so I think this is possible a good place to start a project like this.

Any help and ideas are welcome.

God speed.
